# Build stage runs on the native BUILDPLATFORM (not the target arch): `vp pack`
# emits a portable JS bundle (ws stays external), so it never needs to run under
# emulation. Building once on the native arch is faster (no QEMU for the arm64
# image) and sidesteps Vite+'s native bundler binaries (Rolldown/Oxc) entirely.
